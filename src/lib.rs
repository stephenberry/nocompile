//! Assert that code does **not** compile.
//!
//! A compile-fail test asserts that a program does not build, and that it fails
//! for the intended reason. That is a class of invariant no runtime test can
//! express, because the whole point is that the offending code never exists as a
//! binary: a derive refusing a shape it cannot support, a macro's generated
//! identifiers staying unnameable, a sealed trait staying sealed, a const
//! assertion firing at compile time, a reference that must not escape a closure.
//! Without a test that tries to break the guard and observes the error, a
//! refactor can quietly remove it while every runtime test still passes.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```no_run
//! // tests/ui.rs
//! #[test]
//! fn ui() {
//!     let mut t = nocompile::cases!();
//!     t.dependency_path("my-crate", ".");   // fixtures need the crate under test
//!     t.compile_fail_dir("tests/ui");       // every .rs beside its .stderr
//!     t.assert();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Every fixture becomes a bin target of one generated project and they all
//! compile in a single, parallel `cargo build`. A `compile_fail` fixture must fail, and
//! its diagnostics must match the `.stderr` golden beside it. Run the suite with
//! `NOCOMPILE=overwrite` to write the goldens, then **read what they captured** --
//! a missing golden is a failure rather than an implicit bless precisely so that
//! step does not get skipped.
//!
//! # Living with toolchain churn
//!
//! Goldens of rendered diagnostics break whenever rustc reflows a message. That
//! is inherent to the technique, but [`Mode::Brief`] makes it much cheaper:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # let mut t = nocompile::cases!();
//! t.mode(nocompile::Mode::Brief);
//! ```
//!
//! `Brief` compares only error codes, primary messages and span headers, and
//! drops the source snippets, underline art and `= note:` lines that a rustc
//! release reflows. It still catches every regression that matters: a fixture
//! that stops failing, or starts failing for a different reason. On this crate's
//! own UI suite it takes 33 golden lines down to 7.
//!
//! # Zero dependencies, dev-dependencies included
//!
//! This crate depends on nothing but `std`, and it has no dev-dependencies
//! either -- a `[dev-dependencies]` entry shows up in `cargo tree` for anyone
//! auditing the source, and a harness that reaches for a helper crate to test
//! itself has undermined its own pitch. Its own compile-fail suite is run by
//! itself.
//!
//! If you do not track your dependency count, [`trybuild`] is more capable and
//! you should use it. This crate is for the case where a handful of compile-fail
//! fixtures should not cost a serialization framework and a TOML parser in the
//! lock file.
//!
//! [`trybuild`]: https://docs.rs/trybuild
//!
//! # Scope
//!
//! Deliberately out: running the compiled program and checking its output, glob
//! patterns, inferring dependencies from the host manifest, cross-compilation,
//! custom targets, `-Z` flags, and nightly-only features. The moment a suite
//! needs any of those, `trybuild` is the answer. Windows is not supported in
//! v1 -- path normalization and the `\r\n` question need someone with a Windows
//! machine to get right, and claiming support without testing it is worse than
//! not claiming it.
//!
//! # Requirements on fixtures
//!
//! - A fixture is built as a bin and compiled **verbatim**, so it must define
//!   `fn main`, as `trybuild` fixtures do. The harness does not add one:
//!   detecting a real `fn main` needs a parser, and a wrong guess writes
//!   harness-injected source into the golden under the fixture's own name. A
//!   fixture without one gets a plain `E0601`, which says what to do about it.
//! - Fixtures build with `--offline`, so any dependency must be a path
//!   dependency or already in the local cargo cache.
//! - Warnings from the crate under test land in the fixture's stderr and so in
//!   its golden, exactly as they do with `trybuild`. Keep the crate under test
//!   warning-clean, or use [`Mode::Brief`].
//! - A diagnostic message beginning with `aborting due to` is suppressed by
//!   **cargo itself**, before any harness can see it, because cargo filters
//!   rustc's own abort line there. If a `compile_error!` in your crate is worded
//!   that way it will never reach a golden; word it differently.
//!
//! # Concurrency
//!
//! Every fixture in a run is written to the same scratch `src/main.rs`, so a run
//! holds an exclusive lock on its scratch project and concurrent runs serialize.
//! Two `#[test]` functions each calling [`cases!`] is safe, as is `cargo
//! nextest` or two `cargo test` invocations at once -- without the lock they
//! would compile each other's fixtures and report a broken fixture as passing.
